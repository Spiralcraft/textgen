<h3>Processing Lifecycle</h3>
A TGL compilation unit goes through a number of stages during its
processing lifecycle <br>
<h4>Compilation Stage</h4>
The Parser separates the compilation unit into text and tags, which are
fed to the Compiler as they are read. The Compiler assembles the
collection of text and tags into a tree of TextUnits and ElementUnits.
A single tree of Units is associated with a unique compilation unit.<br>
<br>
Each distinct ElementUnit in a TGL compilation unit is associated with
an unique AssemblyClass, which is a subclass of the AssemblyClass or
Java Class associated with the namespace qualified tag name of the
Element. <br>
<br>
The TGL Attributes associated with the Element are transposed into
property specifiers for this AssemblyClass. This uses the introspection
and configuration mechanisms of SpiralBuilder to configure Elements.<br>
<br>
A compiled TGL compilation unit is represented by an instance of the
RootUnit class, which in turn references the rest of the Unit tree. <br>
<br>
<h4>Binding Stage</h4>
When the application context has been appropriately configured, one or
more Element trees can be instantiated from the RootUnit and bound to
the application context. <br>
<br>
The Binding operation accepts 2 parameters- the parent Assembly
(optional) and the Focus for expression resolution.<br>
<br>
The parent Assembly is used when application specific Element Assembly
classes are coded to work in an application specific context. The
parent Assembly allows access to that design level context. <br>
<br>
The Focus is the primary means for resolving expressions in TGL. Each
Element in the tree can simply inherit the focus of its parent, or
introduce a new level of indirection. Some Elements (mainly iterators)
will add a Focus which changes the subject so that subject based
expressions (anonymous dot references) will resolve to an appropriate
context. Other Elements may add or change the Context namespace in the
focus.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
To Do: There is currently no way to indicate that an attribute contains
an expression instead of a textual value. Currently, attribute
assignments are used as property specifiers in the Assembly classes
which make up the Element tree. If these were treated as expressions
with respect to the Assembly tree, they would be slighly misleading
because they would not take into account the 'run time' Focus, which is
used to evaluate expression elements. WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DATA
PROVIDED BY THE ELEMENT, NOT THE ELEMENT ITSELF.<br>
<br>
So currently, expressions in attributes are expressed as textual values
applied to Elements, which must do their own binding to the Focus
supplied through the Element tree.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to avoid using special prefixes (a.k.a. the Microsoft
hack of using ~ before a stirng to indicate an expression). Maybe
attribute="value" or attribute='expression'. Any kind of GUI though
would need an extra flag for indicate data type. Maybe the attribute
name could be altered- attribute="value" or attribute.x="expression".
Options::<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>attribute="value"&nbsp; attribute.x="expression"</li>
  <li>attribute="value"&nbsp; attribute=="expression"</li>
  <li>attribute="value"&nbsp; attribute=$"expression"</li>
  <li>attribute="value"&nbsp; attribute='expression'<br>
Requires an entity to escape ' within expressions- not too bad, though<br>
  </li>
  <li>attribute="value"&nbsp; attribute=expression<br>
This is the most aesthetically pleasing, IMHO, but we don't know how to
delimit cleanly.</li>
</ul>
We also need to find a way to apply our own Focus to the assembly when
instantiating. This would allow expressions to be resolved in an
appropriate context. This might be accomplished by changed the
-subject- of the assembly to the subject of the Focus- but we want to
access Context in attribute expressions as well. Can we really have it
both ways? We don't get to provide a focus when instantiating
Assemblies. Then again, the "globalized" nature of Context can result
in namespace collisions any way you look at it. Not the best data model
to use, unless you enforce localized Context or manage the scope
carefully. Scope management would start to fall to individual Elements,
and should probably be supported by the API. <br>
<br>
Perhaps the solution to this problem is to treat ALL attribute values
as expressions, since output text is more easily provided outside of
Tags. In this case, we should use single quotes to reduce escape
problems with double quotes in text. We can use a \ escape for single
quotes. This will require custom attribute parser, which isn't too bad.
We can then provide internal support for binding expressions and
managing scope within the Element API- Elements can declare
attributes/properties appropriate for binding to the runtime context
and indicate to their common base class how they want to handle scoping
and an other issues. This is ultimately how the code layer and the
runtime language layer can communicate. <br>
<br>
So now that we've eliminated our ability to use propertySpecifiers to
bind to Elements, we need another way. Perhaps we need to create
bindings between the expression and the property of the Element
specified by the attribute name. This is ideally done at bind time (go
figure?)<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
To Do: Another issue to solve is the referencing of other TGL
compilation units. We need to avoid introducing redundant compilation
stages triggered from bind stages. This might be accomplished by a
compiler directive. THIS IS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT SSI. <br>
<br>
We might want to figure out a way of translating the context in this
case- aka. explicit paramaterization<br>
